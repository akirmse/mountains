// This class is responsible for converting a terrain tile into a
// divide tree.  The algorithm is:
//
// * Find all peaks and saddles.  A peak is a flat area higher than
// its entire boundary.  A saddle is a flat area with at least two
// non-touching higher areas in its boundary.  If there are more than
// two higher areas, the saddle must be split into multiple saddles,
// each with a multiplicity of 2.
//
// * Walk up divides (via steepest ascent) from each saddle to two
// peaks.  If the walk encounters a flat region, find the highest
// point adjacent to the flat region.
//
// * If the two walks reach the same peak, the saddle is false and
// is discarded.  Otherwise, an edge is added to the divide tree
// between the two peaks.  If this would create a cycle, the edge with
// the lowest saddle on the cycle is removed.  This lowest saddle
// is called a "basin saddle" and is not used past this point.
//
// * Compute runoffs around the edge of the tile, and add runoff->peak
// edges to the divide tree by walking uphill from each runoff.
